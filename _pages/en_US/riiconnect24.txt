[RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz/) allows you to use the News or Forecast Channel, exchange mail between Wiis and PC, vote on polls, and other WiiConnect24 features. It replaces the built-in WiiConnect24 system.

As it stands, RiiConnect24 does not support the Wii U yet, so please do not install it on a Wii U yet.
<br>
So far only the News, Forecast, and Everybody Votes Channels work, but check [the stats page](https://rc24.xyz/stats/index.html) for further developments.
{: .notice--warning}

In order to install RiiConnect24 you must be on Wii Menu version 4.3, otherwise mail will not work.

1. Follow the instructions it gives you. Upon it finishing, copy the `WAD` folder to your SD Card.
1. You should get the Everybody Votes Channel. It needs to be installed **even if you already have the Everybody Votes Channel on your Wii, because you will need a patched WAD you reinstall with**.

1. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.
1. Launch Wii Mod Lite.
1. Using the +Control Pad on your Wii Remote, navigate to `WAD Manager`, and then navigate to the `WAD` folder.
1. When `IOS31.wad` is highlighted, press +, then do the same for `IOS80.wad` and the Everybody Votes Channel WAD.
1. If you get an error saying a title with a higher version is already installed (error -1035), go back to the WAD selection menu and press - on the highlighted Everybody Votes Channel WAD, then try installing it again.
1. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.

##### Section II - Patching nwc24msg.cfg

You will now patch your `nwc24msg.cfg` file which is required in order to use Wii Mail.

1. It should only take a few seconds to patch your nwc24msg.cfg. When it's done, press HOME to exit.

If the previous step failed with an ``net_get_status: -24 - Couldn't request the data: -24` error, please check the internet connection on your Wii.
